# KDeltaT POLICY SOFTWARE

Welcome to the official repository of the **KDeltaT Policy Software** , a web application for planning the maintenance of protection systems subject to shocks. This application has been developed by [Augusto J. S. Rodrigues](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7042-9270) and [Cristiano A. V. Cavalcante](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1466-656X).

This tool was designed for broad accessibility in the industry, eliminating the need for extensive knowledge of mathematical modeling or programming languages.

## Access to the application

This application is sometimes suspended due to inactivity. To reactivate it, simply click on the button available for this purpose.

## On the maintenance policy model

The basis of this software is the model described in our scientific article, **"A general inspection and replacement policy for protection systems subject to shocks with state dependent effect"**, by Augusto J. S. Rodrigues, Cristiano A. V. Calvancante & Chi-Guhn Lee.

The article is currently under review, and the link to access it will be made available after acceptance.

## Collaborations

We welcome contributions, feedback, and discussions regarding the software and the policy model it implements. Whether you're a researcher, industry professional, or enthusiast in the field of maintenance planning and protection systems, your insights are invaluable to us.
